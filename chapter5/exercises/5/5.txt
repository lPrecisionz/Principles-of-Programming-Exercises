grammar for bitwise logical operators.

possible operators are: 
  
! -> not
~ -> complement
& -> and
| -> or
^ -> xor

points to acknowledge

! and ~ are prefix unary operators (possibly our primary)
^ binds tighter than |
& binds tighter than ^

apparent order (top - bottom):

&
^
|
! ~
bits

actually, our primary are probably the bits themselves

the question says that these are logical expressions, so our top is probably an expression

first sketch:

Expression: 
  Ors
  Expression & Ors 
Ors:          // no idea how to name this
  Unary
  Idk ^ Unary
  Idk | Unary
Unary: 
  Bit
  ~ Bit
  ! Bit
Bit: 
  0
  1

I think bits can be a collection of bits, not sure

^ and | should probably be in different levels (^ below)


After some thought.. 

Unary should be before the operand, as we could parse !!, for example
give ^ and | their own levels
change bit to literal or whatever

second attempt

Expression:
  Or
  Expression & Or

Or:
  Xor
  Or | Xor

Xor:
  Primary
  Xor ^ Primary 

Primary:
  Unary
  Literal

Unary: 
  !
  ~

gpt said above was miserable so here we go again: 

actually misunderstood "tighter binding" in reverse order, so here's a redo: 

! -> not
~ -> complement
& -> and
^ -> xor
| -> or
  
Expression: 
  Xor
  Expression | Xor
Xor:
  And
  Xor ^ And
And: 
  Unary
  And & Unary
Unary: 
  Primary
  ~ Unary
  ! Unary
Primary: 
  Number
  "(" Expression ")"
Number: 
  Integer literal

I think that's the best I can guess following the arithmetic one.

As a task for this exercise; this document is meant to plan out the design of the program.

What should the program do? 
  
  User receives prompt -> 
    Do you wish to do permutation or Combination? 

  User inputs answer -> 
    'p' or 'c'

  User responds 'p' or 'c' -> 
    Prompt user for a and b.
  
  Show Result. -> Go back to start

Formulas
  P(a, b) = (a!) / ((a-b)!)
  C(a, b) = (P(a,b))/(b!)

Pseudo code: 

while(true){
  read_input(operation);
  if(operation == 'q') break;
  read_input(a, b);
  show_result(a, b, operation);
}

class Solver{
  int a, b;
  char operation;

  void read_input();
  void show_result;

  private: 
    int solve();
    int factorial();
    int permutation();
    int combination();
}
